- make settings in user folder not the repo. Settings folder should just be for templates
- rename/restructure templates as tasks, protocols. make protocol a base class of tasks
- restructure folder of hardware objects - LEDs, Ports, etc. that all have their own logic
- Make inits and the RPilot object more generic - init hardware rather than pins, etc.
    - Make all the hardware logic as separate objects, and have the mouse & protocol determine which hardware is present
    - Same with load_sounds, the speakers/sound driver should be a hardware object.


------------------
!- make name param for steps
!- implement protocol assignation in mouse object
!- implement protocol assignation in 'new mouse' dialog
!- make popup protocol params dialog
- drag and drop mice order
- send sound files
- make multiple network keys - not just 'X' but also 'Pis', 'plots,' etc.
- Make verbose/nonverbose mode - either report whole trials or events
- Just have events, no data messages. check if the message dict has a field 'TRIALEND' or something to flush a row
- Backfill logging into terminal & etc.

TO SET THE NOSEPOKE WAIT TIME, USE TABLE TRIGGERS:
>>> tabr = TableRead(SNDS_PATH + "/transparent.aif").out()
>>> trig = TrigRand(tabr['trig'])

- classic mode, button that switches the UI to flickering grey screen
